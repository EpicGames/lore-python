# Contributing

The Lore Python SDK follows the Lore project contribution process. Issues and
pull requests are welcome in this repository.

## Prerequisites

- **Python 3.10+** with [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) for dependency management
- **`LORE_BUILD_PATH`** — env var pointing to a local Lore native library build from source:
  ```sh
  export LORE_BUILD_PATH="/<path-to>/lore/target/release"
  ```

## Build and test

```sh
uv venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
uv pip install --group dev
uv run python find_lorelib.py
uv run python generator/generate.py
uv pip install -e .
```

Run the tests:

```sh
uv run pytest
```

## Formatting

Formatting is enforced by CI and must pass before any PR is merged:

```sh
uv run black .      # auto-format; run before committing
uv run isort .      # sort imports; run before committing
```

## Before you code

For anything beyond a trivial fix, open a GitHub Issue and wait for a
maintainer to weigh in before investing significant effort. Changes to the
wire protocol or `lore-capi` belong in the
[Lore repository](https://github.com/EpicGames/lore), not here.

## Commit sign-off

Every commit must include a `Signed-off-by:` line. Add it with
`git commit -s`. The DCO, patent affirmation, copyright header rules, and
license compatibility policy are all defined in the canonical contributing
doc.

## Full contribution policy

The full PR process, review process, AI assistance policy, legal terms, and
community channels are published in the Lore repository:
